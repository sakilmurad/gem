We are going to create a secondry user for our GeM account and will assign his/her role. We have created and copleted our profile in <Link href="/Profile-completion">previous articles</Link>.
In this article we are going to create a secondry user and manage his/her role.
## Create secondry user
First login to your GeM Account and go to the profile section.

Go to My Team

You can see two options here, one is "User List"[^1] and another one is "Add Secondary User"[^2]

Enter the Email Id of the users and select roles for him/her[^3]. Then click on "ADD USER" button.

The activation link will be sent to the secondry user's Email. Open the mail and click on "Verify me now" button.
