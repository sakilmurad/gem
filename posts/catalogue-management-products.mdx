The Catalogue Management System enables the Sellers & Service providers to broadcast their product, services, price changes and introduce new items.

In this article we will go through the all process required to **list your product on the GeM Portal**. These are:
1. **Category Creation**
2. **Adding the Brand Name**
3. **Clone Existing Catalogue**
4. **Edit the Catalogue**
Before we get started, first you may check <Link href="/profile-completion">Profile Completion</Link> articles to complete your GeM Profile. Because, without completing your profile, you can't list any product or service on GeM Portal. And for better understanding of the seller dashboard, you may read <Link href="/seller-dashboard-overview">Seller Dashboard Overview</Link> article.

## Category Creation
**There are 9877 categories are available on the GeM Portal**, but sometime we can't get the right one for our product. Therefore we are starting with **Creating a New Category on GeM Portal**.

Login to the GeM with your UserId and Password and *Catalogue* link on the header. Hover (Move your mouse) on that link, you will see two option, one is Products and another one is Services. Again hover on the Products link and then click on *Add New Offering*.
