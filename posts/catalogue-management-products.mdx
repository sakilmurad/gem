In this article we will go through the all process required to **list your product on the GeM Portal**. These are:

1. **Category Creation**
2. **Adding Brand Name**
3. **Add new Listing**
4. **Clone Existing Catalogue**
5. **Edit the Catalogue**

Before we get started, first you may check <Link href="/profile-completion">Profile Completion</Link> articles to complete your GeM Profile. Because, without completing your profile, you can't list any product or service on GeM Portal. And for better understanding of the seller dashboard, you may read <Link href="/seller-dashboard-overview">Seller Dashboard Overview</Link> article.

## Category Creation

**There are more than 10000 categories are available on the GeM Portal**, but sometime we can't get the right one for our product. Therefore we are starting with **Creating a New Category on GeM Portal**.

Login to the GeM with your User Id and Password and find the _Catalogue_ link on the header. Hover (Move your mouse) on that link, you will see two option, one is Products and another one is Services. Again hover on the Products link and then click on "_Add New Offering_".

The new listing creation page will open. Left side you can see the category search option. Simply you can just search your category. You can get the available category matching with your search (if available).

If you are unable to find the right one for your product, then click on "_Cannot find a suitable category? Click here to submit a request for creation of a new category or to suggest changes in an existing category_" link to create one.

Request Management tab will popup. You can create a request from here. Select "_Request type_" as "_New category creation_". Fill the description and upload the supporting document and click on "_Generate Request_" button.

### Update in the existing category

To update or suggest any change in the existing category, you may select "_Request for Category Up-gradation_". Enter the description and upload supporting document and click on the "_Generate Request_" button.

You can check the status of the request created by you by clicking on the "_View My Request_" button.

## Adding Brand Name

There are two ways available for a newly added seller to list his/her product on the GeM Portal, one is to list product on **Unbranded** and second one is to **Add their own Brand**. Brand name creation is very simple process on the GeM Portal than other Marketplace like Amazon or Flipkart.
